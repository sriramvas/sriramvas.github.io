Every individual is like a black box. No one gets to see or know our internal world truly. 

People around us might see us objectively, but they don’t have access to our subjective experiences, our private thoughts, our emotions, memories, and feelings. 

This is the hidden, inner layer of who we are that no one else can reach or fully understand.

This is why empathy is so difficult. We can’t fully grasp what someone else is feeling, nor can we ever fully share the weight of our own experiences with others.

Language and social identities are like rough sketches—they might get part of the what we are across, but they’re nowhere enough to share the fullness of our internal world.

**So why do we create?**

Creation is how we express ourselves in a form that others can grasp. 

Whether through art, dance, music, writing or even talking—creation is our way of making the subjective visible.

When we create authentically, we’re giving people a real glimpse into our own perspective. We’re saying, “this is my view; this is my truth.” 

It’s why we see creators so often standing beside their work, taking pride in it, identifying with it. 

Being next to their creation, they know people can see them through it. It’s not just about the creation itself—it’s the satisfaction of being understood, of having part of their inner world revealed.

**Creations let us share our experience**

Each of us views the world through a unique lens shaped by our experiences, memories, and moments that have moved us.

Maybe it’s a photographer capturing a sunset that held a quiet joy for them, or an author reliving a deeply personal experience, hoping readers might feel a fraction of what they felt.

Creation is a piece of someone's world frozen in time, and allows a fragment of their emotion, their truth, to reach us.

we’re invited to step into it, to witness a moment as they did, and, perhaps, to understand them just a little more.

**Creation transforms the creator**

When we go through the act of creating, we’re forced to clarify, refine, and understand our own inner worlds.

Every line, every note, every movement brings us closer to discovering parts of ourselves.

in a world where so much of who we are stays hidden, creation is a rare way to bridge the gap. 

Each piece of art, each deeply felt expression, opens a window into the private worlds we all carry. 

In these glimpses, we find understanding and the shared human need to be seen, known, and connected—even if only for a moment.
